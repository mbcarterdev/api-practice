# api-practice
practice with apis on front and back

#current issues
-still need EJS template for first api
-mass and height sorting on 2nd api is inconsistent
-on both 2nd and 3rd api, would like to adjust output to just the name and sorted property (or planet and name only) so it is easier to read
-should build a separate helper function for parsing the promise results
